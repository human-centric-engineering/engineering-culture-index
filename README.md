# Engineering Culture Index

## Intro
The Engineering Culture Index survey is based on 12 categories of questions to understand the subjective experience of engineers. The categories are grouped into three columns representing the dimensions of intrinsic human motivation identified by Self-Determination Theory, namely Mastery, Autonomy and Purpose so that the survey is directly related to aspects of human motivation and thriving. In all, there are 72 statements which use a Likert scale to capture a positive or negative response from the engineer. Woven into the survey is the evidence-based research of Ron Westrum and the predictive influence of organisational culture on software delivery performance and organisational performance.

Culture, by its emergent nature, defies accurate measurement. It is an intuitive ‘tacit knowing’ derived from our subjective experiences. Culture results from our collective underlying assumptions and worldviews and our experience of the interactions which ensue from acting on our beliefs and values. The Engineering Culture Index is a working hypothesis on engineering culture which is version controlled and will be modified over time to reflect emerging insights and changes in the craft of software engineering.

## Rationale for the Questions and the Structure
The questions are Likert Scale statements to which individual engineers will be asked to signify their level of agreement according to 7 suggested degrees: Strongly Disagree; Disagree; Somewhat Disagree; Neither Agree or Disagree; Somewhat Agree; Agree; Strongly Agree. The questions relate to a software engineer's subjective assessment of the engineering culture as they experience it.

The questions are categorised according to Self-Determination theory describes three dimensions which are critical to a feeling of intrinsic motivation, namely Mastery, Autonomy and Purpose. Each category has 4 subsets containing 6 questions, 2 questions are about how the engineer experiences their organisation, 2 are about their experience of working in teams, and 2 questions are about them as individuals and the impact they have on their engineering culture. The reason for this structure is that by simply taking the questionnaire engineers will learn about the key aspects of motivation and self-determination which can be consciously influenced to improve their developer experience. The format of the questions also shows engineers that they can have direct influence over their engineering culture, rather than seeing culture solely as something which is thrust upon us by the organisation. Analysis of the respondent's answers will reveal leverage points where changes can be made to optimise engineering culture over time.

* Self-Determination Theory was popularised by Daniel Pink in his book, Drive, based on earlier research into intrinsic motivation by Edward L. Deci and Richard Ryan.
