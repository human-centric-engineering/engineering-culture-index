## Intro

## The Questions
Below are links to Likert Scale statements to which individual engineers will be asked to signify their level of agreement according to 7 suggested degrees: Strongly Disagree; Disagree; Somewhat Disagree; Neither Agree or Disagree; Somewhat Agree; Agree; Strongly Agree. The questions relate to a software engineer's subjective assessment of the engineering culture as they experience it. The questions are categorised according to Self-Determination theory describes three dimensions which are critical to a feeling of intrinsic motivation, namely Mastery, Autonomy and Purpose. Each category has 4 subsets containing 6 questions, 2 questions are about how the engineer experiences their organisation, 2 are about their experience of working in teams, and 2 questions are about them as individuals and the impact they have on their engineering culture. The reason for this structure is that by simply taking the questionnaire engineers will learn about the key aspects of motivation and self-determination which can be consciously influenced to improve their developer experience. The format of the questions also shows engineers that they can have direct influence over their engineering culture, rather than seeing culture solely as something which is thrust upon us by the organisation. Analysis of the respondent's answers will reveal leverage points where changes can be made to optimise engineering culture over time.
