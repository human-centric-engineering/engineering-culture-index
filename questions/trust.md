# Trust


## Key Characteristics
Dependability, Psychological Safety, Strong Relationships, Honest Conversations

## Description
Trust is foundational to having a working environment where people can speak directly to one another, raise concerns, ask probing questions and challenge one another's thinking so that the best decisions are taken with commitment and accountability. When delivering as an autonomous team, people must be able to trust that the workload is distributed fairly with people contributing in good faith, relative to their skills and abilities.

## Questions
| | STATEMENT  	| INTENT  	|
|---	|---	|---	|
| 1. | As a self-organising team, we trust each other to deliver high-quality work and meet our commitments, seeking support when needed.	| People in autonomous teams need to feel they can depend on the skills and capabilities of their colleagues along with the wisdom to know when they need help. A low score may prompt an inquiry into the balance of team skills and abilities.	|
| 2. | We have sufficient levels of trust within our team to allow us to have constructive conflict when working through important challenges or decisions.	| Constructive conflict is an important part of making autonomous decisions as a team. If people are unable to work through their conflicts, they will not feel committed to the team's decisions	|
| 3. | Efforts are distributed fairly, with every member actively contributing to software delivery.	| It's important to feel that people are pulling their weight so there is a sense of organisational justice. A low score could indicate that some team members are not participating fully causing a lack of dependability. |
| 4. | Psychological safety within our team allows for the free expression of opinions and ideas, challenging each otherâ€™s thinking, without fear of negative consequences.	|	Google's Project Aristotle highlighted Psychological Safety as the primary factor in team success as people need to trust they can expose reality and robustly challenge one another's thinking if they want to collectively do their best work. |
| 5. | Our team members take ownership of their contributions and work collaboratively towards achieving collective goals. | Taking ownership is key to creating a feeling of autonomy. If people do not feel a strong ownership of the output of the work then there may be a prevailing apathy which erodes people's sense of autonomy. |
| 6. | There is strong trust within our organisation, between teams and departments and generally between individuals at all levels | The wider context of organisational trust provides the context for trust within an individual team. A low score may be indicative of a lack of organisational cohesion which may create a 'them and us' disharmony. The remedy for organisational trust will require honest introspection at all levels. |
