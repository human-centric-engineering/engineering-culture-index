# Trust


## Key Characteristics
Dependability, Psychological Safety, Strong Relationships, Honest Conversations

## Description
Trust is foundational to having a working environment where people can speak directly to one another, raise concerns, ask probing questions and challenge one another's thinking so that the best decisions are taken with commitment and accountability. When delivering as an autonomous team, people must be able to trust that the workload is distributed fairly with people contributing in good faith, relative to their skills and abilities.

## Questions
| | STATEMENT  	| ASSUMPTIONS 	| INTERPRETATION |
|---	|-------	|---	|---	|
| 1. | In our organisation there is strong trust between teams and departments and between individuals at all levels | The wider context of organisational trust provides the context for trust within an individual team. | A low score may be indicative of a lack of organisational cohesion which may create an 'us and them' disharmony. The remedy for organisational trust will require honest introspection at all levels. |
| 2. | In our organisation we have sufficient levels of trust and psychological safety to allow us to have constructive conflict when working through important challenges or decisions.	| Constructive conflict is an important part of making autonomous decisions. | If people are unable to work through their conflicts, they will not feel committed to the organisation's decisions	|
| 3. | Within our teams we trust each other to deliver high-quality work and meet our commitments, seeking support when needed.	| People in autonomous teams need to feel they can depend on the skills and capabilities of their colleagues along with the wisdom to know when they need help. | A low score may prompt an inquiry into the balance of team skills and abilities.	|
| 4. | Within our teams, efforts are distributed fairly, with every member actively contributing to software delivery.	| It's important to feel that people are pulling their weight so there is a sense of organisational justice. | A low score could indicate that some team members are not participating fully causing a lack of dependability. |
| 5. | I consciously strive to ensure that people feel psychologically safe in my presence, able to challenge my thinking and freely express their opinions and ideas without fearing negative consequences.	|	Google's Project Aristotle highlighted Psychological Safety as the primary factor in team success as people need to trust they can expose reality and robustly challenge one another's thinking if they want to collectively do their best work. | | 
| 6. | I take ownership of my contributions and work collaboratively towards achieving collective goals. | Taking ownership is key to creating a feeling of autonomy. | If people do not feel a strong ownership of the output of the work then there may be a prevailing apathy which erodes people's sense of autonomy. |
