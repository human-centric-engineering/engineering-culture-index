# Agency

## Key Characteristics
Influence, Autonomy, Empowerment, Ownership, Accountability, Self-Organising Teams, and Sustainable Pace.

## Description
By having agency, individuals gain a strong sense of control over their working lives, and they are more likely to take ownership of their decisions and actions. Agency fosters a deeper sense of responsibility, empowerment, influence, self-direction and self-organisation, allowing individuals and teams to embrace challenges without an over-dependence on external input. Freedom is only effective when people also take responsibility.
