## Questions

| | STATEMENT  	| ASSUMPTIONS 	| INTERPRETATION |
|---	|---	|---	|---	|
| 1. | Our organisation values ideas based on their merit, regardless of who or where they come from.  	| This is the essence of Ray Dalio's 'Idea Meritocracy' which is important in giving people a sense that they have agency and that their good ideas matter. | Low scores may indicate that the organisational hierarchy is overbearing or worse that there is a prevailing nepotism or favouritism which stifles idea sharing.	|
| 2. | Our organisation ensures that the responsibilities of each team are clearly defined, minimising ambiguity and fostering smooth collaboration and inter-team coordination.  	| Clear  ownership boundaries will foster a sense of responsibility for the health and integrity of system components. | Low scores may indicate a feeling of helplessness or lack of control over one's working domain and a need for clearer structural boundaries of ownership and accountability.	|
| 3. | Within our teams, we have the autonomy to make decisions about the use of tools and technologies that best suit our needs. | The assumption, as purported in the book 'Accelerate' is teams are more effective when they can choose the tools which are most suitable for their particular needs. | Low scores may indicate that bureaucratic control of tooling is limiting the potential performance of autonomous teams.	|
| 4. | Our teams are self-organising, with the authority to address local issues and challenges without needing bureaucratic approval.	| The assumption is that the people closest to the problem are best positioned to understand it and organise themselves to deal with it.  | Low scores may indicate the presence of overbearing external control.	|
| 5. | I have the freedom to take full ownership of the development, deployment, and overall health and viability of the system components we are responsible for in our team.  	|   	| | 
| 6. | I embody the idea that my own decisions, actions and behaviours have a contributory effect on our engineering culture as a whole. | Culture is created mimetically, through modelling and copying behaviours. | Low scores may indicate that engineers are caught up in their own doom loop and do not realise their own power to influence the culture they want through their own decisions, actions, and behaviours to create a positive flywheel effect. 	|
