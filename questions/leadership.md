# Leadership

## Key Characteristics
Organisational Cohesion, Communication, Data-Driven Decisions, Learning Organisation, and Shared Responsibility.

## Description
Strong leadership is essential to orienting people to their purpose, creating both the direction of travel and curating the overall experience of teams and individuals. People are motivated by leadership they can have confidence in and one that genuinely cares about the people involved in the process, creating a sense that individuals and their efforts matter.

## Questions

| | STATEMENT  	| INTENT  	| INTERPRETATION |
|---	|---	|---	|---	|
| 1. | Senior leaders demonstrate humility, accessibility, and a genuine willingness to listen to software engineers' ideas, fostering an environment of trust and open communication. | People have a fundamental need to be seen, heard and understood. | Low scores may indicate that people's fundamental needs are being neglected or that status differentials are an obstacle to communication. |
| 2. | I have confidence in the senior leadership's ability to make well-informed decisions that align with the best interests of software engineering teams.	| Software engineering teams are often impacted by decisions outside of their control, so it is important to trust that decisions are being made in good faith.  | Low scores may reveal a lack of trust throughout the organisational hierarchy.	|
| 3. | Senior leadership communicates important events promptly and transparently, keeping the team well-informed and engaged and able to act on new information.	| The business landscape is ever-changing and uncertain, so leaders must sense and respond to events. People in the organisation expect to be informed in a timely, truthful and inclusive way. | If people are not kept up to date with events they are unable to make informed decisions and a culture of suspicion and mistrust will emerge. | 
| 4. | Our organisation promotes a culture of shared responsibility and risk, encouraging collective problem-solving and cross-functional collaboration for well-rounded solutions.	| Strong leadership encourages boundary bridging so for interdepartmental alignment and a blameless sharing of responsibilities. | Different teams working at cross purposes or with conflicting incentives are damaging to morale and wasteful. A low score may highlight a need for ensuring that inter-team goals are aligned within a structure where boundary bridging is encouraged. | 
| 5. | Data and evidence play a central role in our decision-making processes, ensuring informed choices and fostering a data-driven culture.	| Decisions that are backed by evidence, data, and reasoning are much more likely to gain the support and commitment of those responsible for their implementation.	| Low scores may highlight a 'might is right' attitude where decisions are made through force of personality or status rather than reason and rational argument. | 
| 6. | In our organisation, the role of senior people is not "making decisions" but "creating conditions" - conditions in which good decisions get made and implemented, innovatively, and iteratively. | As per the advice in the book 'Turn the Ship Around', nurturing an attitude of leadership at all levels of the organisation gives people the opportunity to realise their potential to step up and take responsibility for resolving issues they are faced with directly.	| Low scores may indicate elements of overbearing control which can disincentivise people from using their own initiative. |
