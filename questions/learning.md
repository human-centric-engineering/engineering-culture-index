| 1. | Our team fosters a learning-oriented environment, learning from success and not fearing failure. | Being immersed in a learning culture where it is safe to fail on a trajectory of growth is key to creating an environment that inspires people to learn new things. | Low scores may indicate organisational impatience	or a lack of prioritisation towards individual growth which should prompt an inquiry into what the organisation values in terms of empowering people to learn. |
| 2. | I have access to mentoring and coaching opportunities to support skills learning and career progression.  	| It is important to have the right structures in place to optimise people's learning opportunities.	| Low scores may suggest a need for a more structured approach to ensuring the availability of mentoring and coaching, both in technical skills and soft skills. |
| 3. | We actively invest in learning and staying up-to-date with industry trends and techniques while proactively sharing knowledge among colleagues. | A learning culture depends upon the availability and accessibility of resources which should be up-to-date with industry trends to ensure the relevancy of an individual's personal development	| Poor scores may indicate a half-hearted approach to learning where the provision of time and appropriate resources is neglected. This may signify an opportunity to provide a Learning and Development budget to each engineer to spend at their own discretion	|
| 4. | We value continuous iterative improvement where people are given work that will stretch them by the right amount. |   	|   	|
| 5. | We have constructive and timely feedback regarding our contributions and interactions 	| A culture of seeking and giving feedback in a direct and compassionate manner helps real-time learning that is relevant to one's daily work.	| A low score may indicate issues with social dynamics where people feel uncomfortable or awkward about giving and receiving feedback. This may be an opportunity for discussion and coaching |
| 6. | I am supported in identifying areas for personal and professional development.	| Support for personal and professional development is most likely to be the responsibility of a line manager as a key part of their responsibilities for developing their team as it is essential that people have the opportunity to explore potential paths for progression to identify their direction of learning. | Low scores may indicate the need to ensure proactive line management or more structure in terms of career progression	|
