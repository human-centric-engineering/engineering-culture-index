## Question Statements
The following are Likert Scale statements to which individual engineers will be asked to signify their level of agreement according to 7 suggested degrees: Strongly Disagree; Disagree; Somewhat Disagree; Neither Agree or Disagree; Somewhat Agree; Agree; Strongly Agree.

| | STATEMENT  	| INTENT  	|
|---	|---	|---	|
| 1. | Striving for technical excellence in our work is encouraged and valued within our team.	| Reveals team-level attitudes towards craftsmanship. A low score or a score with high variance may highlight an opportunity to discuss people's personal aspirations, discussions about what technical excellence looks like, and what is getting in the way of striving for technical excellence. |
| 2. | We actively seek feedback from each other to validate and improve the quality of our work. | We can't easily see the flaws in our own work so seeking feedback and opinion from others helps to create a more rounded perspective. A low score may reveal poor attitudes around quality or poor social dynamics which hinder the seeking of alternative opinions. |
| 3. | We prioritise building quality into our software from the outset rather than relying on downstream tests.	| When quality is 'left-shifted', engineers get more immediate feedback over the quality of their work and a greater sense of accountability for quality. |
| 4. | I am not pressured into taking shortcuts that may compromise the quality of my work. | Pressure, real or imagined causes people to make mistakes or ignore quality concerns. A low score highlights an opportunity to understand where the pressure is coming from and assess ways of reducing unnecessary pressure	|
| 5. | Over time, our attitude towards craftsmanship and commitment to quality continues to improve.	| Even if our current levels of craftmanship are lower than we would like, a trajectory towards improved craftmanship indicates that it is valued and that actions are being taken to continually improve quality. |
