# Creativity

## Key Characteristics
Experimentation, Prototyping, Innovation, Hypothesis-Driven Culture.

## Description
The section is about the sense of creativity you feel when you are working. Whether you have some freedom to experiment, to try new approaches to find the best solution, knowing that some of those approaches may fail.

## Questions
| | STATEMENT  	| ASSUMPTIONS  	| INTERPRETATION |
|--- |---	|---	|---	|
| 1. | Our team encourages experimenting with different approaches to problem-solving, allowing the freedom to explore unconventional ideas.	| There is never one single way of solving a problem and unless there is a culture of experimentation we may miss opportunities to optimise our approach. | A low score may indicate the presence of undue pressure to deliver or the of fear being wrong. |
| 2. | We embrace prototyping, testing, and trying new approaches as a natural part of our development workflow.  	| The assumption is that a creative approach to problem-solving should feel habitual and natural without needing special approval. | Low scores could indicate the presence of paralysing external control or a very fixed way of doing things.	|
| 3. | We feel supported in proposing and implementing improvements to our development processes and workflows.  	| Software delivery workflows often develop bottlenecks which constrain the flow of delivery and software engineers are ideally positioned to see and address the problem. | Low scores may indicate a problem of bureaucracy or ownership issues in terms of removing bottlenecks. |
| 4. | The organisation values bringing ideas to the table, even partially formed ideas, promoting freedom in sharing and developing concepts. | It's important that the wider organisation understands the value of an idea of meritocracy to encourage the evolution of the best ideas. | Low scores may indicate an opportunity to communicate the value of experimentation in software to the wider business. 	|
| 5. | We work in a blame-free environment where calculated risks are encouraged to pursue innovative solutions	| The social risk of being shamed for a mistake can stifle innovation and hamper improvements. | Low scores may indicate the need for further inquiry to understand the sources of potential blame and an opportunity to provide coaching to improve the social dynamics. |
