## Ethos
There is no perfect set of survey questions and there will be many ways to rephrase them to remove ambiguities or to emphasise certain dimensions of engineering culture. Suggestions are welcome, especially if certain questions are confusing or fail to yield useful insights. There will certainly be some very good questions which have not been included in the survey that would highlight a very important aspect of engineering culture. Of course, the whole structural framework of 12 separate categories loosely aligned to self-determination theory may not be the optimal approach. The software engineering domain is ever-changing and so new paradigms will emerge over time which might signal the need for wholesale changes to the survey.

These survey questions are open-sourced for 2 main reasons:
1. So that it may be improved over time via comments and individual contributions
2. Engineers are more likely to engage with a survey that is open-sourced without any hidden motives - the survey promotes the need for 'agency' so it would be disingenuous to create this survey without also giving people the agency to use it for their own purposes or to input directly into its evolution.

## Suggestions 
* All suggestions for modification or improvements to individual questions are welcome as a Pull Request.
* Structural changes or suggestions requiring an element of nuanced thinking can be made by commenting via the 'issues' tab.

Suggestions are particularly welcome from software engineers based on their personal experiences of what is important to them in their work. Suggestions will also be proactively sought from psychologists and specialists in corporate culture.

Suggestions from non-engineers who do not have a GitHub account are welcome via a direct message to the author's [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johndurrant/) account. 

## Frequency of Changes
It is suspected that there will be frequent changes during the early stages of this project (alpha stages) as tweaks are made in response to 'in the field' exposure and feedback. Once the project is beyond the alpha phase, changes will likely be much rarer as the aim will be to reach a stable set of questions which can be used as benchmarks over time.

## Version Control
The project will be version controlled and aligned with Semantic Versioning: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

0.0.1 will be the first alpha release
1.0.1 will be the first production release

A PATCH is a change in the spelling or syntax of a question which doesn't change its fundamental meaning or a change in the surrounding documentation.
A MINOR change is a change to a question which changes the potential interpretation of a question but which aims at assessing a similar sentiment.
A MAJOR change is required when questions are completely rewritten with entirely different meanings.

* During the alpha stage, MAJOR changes will be treated as MINOR changes as there is expected to be a high frequency of such modifications during alpha.
